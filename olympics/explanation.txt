1) even though the sex category for athletes is going to be repeating 'M' and
'F' a bunch, I did not split it into it's own table because otherwise the linking
table would just read a bunch of 1s and 2s.

2) There are multiple teams that fit to one NOC, so I split teams into their
own table.

3) In splitting off NOC and NOC_regions, I noticed some issues with teams and
other things showing up where they should not. That is because my CSV reader
was splitting the file lines in the wrong spots when there was a comma in the
team name, for example. Do I know how to fix that? No I do not. So I am going
to leave it. I also know that it is going to come up in the rest of my CSV
file creations, and I won't be able to change those either.

4) Because more than one games can be matched to a city, I made cities into
a separate table. I see and recognize that some of the entries are years and not
in fact cities. This I am blaming on the above problem of not knowing how to
correctly parse a CSV file.

5) In convert.py, It is not a cohesive program- in fact, it is several little
bitty programs that have been commented out so I could basically copy the code
and do it again with slightly different words.

6) I can't link my data. I don't know how. Therefore, I cannot do the complete
assignment because I simply do not know how to use my database and I don't
even think that it works.
