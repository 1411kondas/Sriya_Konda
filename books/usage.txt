Options

    --findTitle [SEARCH_TEXT] [-y, --year| -a, --alpha]
            Print a list of books whose titles contain a case-insensitive
            search string SEARCH_TEXT. If SEARCH_TEXT is none, all of the
            books in the data set will be returned.
            There are two additional flags that are available for use:

            -y, --year
                Book titles  are sorted by year of publication (old to new).

            -a, --alpha
                Book titles are sorted in alphabetical order (A-Z).

            If no additional flag is used, then the books will be sorted
            alphabetically by default.
            If the search query returns no results, you will receive a message
            that says so.

    --findAuthor [SEARCH_TEXT]
            Print a list of authors and the books they have written based on
            a case-insensitive search string SEARCH_TEXT. If search_text
            is none, all of the authors in the data set will be returned.
            Authors will be printed in alphabetical order by surname and
            ties will be broken by first names.
            If the search query returns no results, you will receive a message
            that says so.

    --findYears [A][B]
            Print a list of books published in and between years A and B.
            A and B must be integers.
            If the search query returns no results, you will receive a message
            that says so.
            If only one year is entered, the search will return all of the books
            published during or after that year. If you would like the books
            published before or during that year, you must follow this format:
              --findYears 0 [YEAR]
            The books are sorted by publication year, and ties are broken by
            title.

    -h, --help
